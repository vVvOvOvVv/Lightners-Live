I've been wanting to create a small scale game project for a while to build up my portfolio, so I thought recreating Lightners Live from Deltarune Chaoter 3 would be fun.
Taking this as an oppurtunity to:
  1. Learn Godot
  2. Learn how to make a rhythm game
  3. Experiment!

Rhythm game controls:
  1. Left & right arrows
  2. Z & X
  3. A & D
  4. F & J
  5. S & K
  6. Left & right (D-Pad)
  7. Bottom (XBox A/X/Nintendo B) and right (XBox B/Circle/Nintendo A)
  8. Or any combination of the above!
